Beginner Friendly Java Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Java programs and common programming examples. It is designed to help learners understand core Java concepts by providing simple, practical code samples.

## Features

- **Basic Java Programs**: Examples covering file handling, area/volume calculations, and more.
- **GUI Examples**: Includes programs using Swing, such as a simple Notepad and ScrollPane demo.
- **Servlet Examples**: Demonstrates basic usage of cookies, sessions, and request dispatching in Java servlets.
- **Database Connectivity**: Sample code to illustrate basic database connections using JDBC.
- **File Operations**: Programs for reading, writing, and copying files.

## Example Programs

- **Area and Volume Calculations**: Calculate area and volume of cuboids with abstract classes and interfaces.
- **File Handling**: Read from and write to files, copy files using streams.
- **GUI Applications**: Notepad and scroll pane using Java Swing.
- **Servlets**: Manage sessions and cookies, and dispatch requests in simple Java web applications.
- **Database Connection**: Basic template to connect and query a database.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
